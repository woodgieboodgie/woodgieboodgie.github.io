Today in the ever changing world of technology, the market for smart homes and automation technology products is getting bigger. It's no longer a futuristic cartoon where your home would be fully automatic, it’s actually a reality.<br>
<br>
On the market today there is a wide range of smart home devices and gadgets, starting from lighting, to audio video equipment, home security systems, thermostats, irrigation, blinds, power points, garage doors, etc. Building a living space that’s automated is easy – as it doesn’t require any scientific knowledge or an IT engineering background to do so.<br>
<br>
<b>This is for everyone!</b> All you need now is to know where to start. Here at House-Mate Automation smart technologies and home automation devices are what we’re all about. If you’re just starting in this space the best thing to do is start with the fundamentals. When talking about smart homes or home automation in general, we’re referring to a variety of devices, gadgets, appliances, and systems, which are connected and communicating with each other, in order to manage your home.  Once connected they can autonomously without any input operate your home - of course according to your setup and requirements. <br>
<br>
There are a wide range of devices that fall into this category. Ranging from devices that aren’t fully automated on their their own, to semi-auto operation, to devices that’s a one-time setup and set-forget.<br>
<br>
Many devices and gadgets require minimal input from the user, which is usually done via your smartphone, tablet, any internet-connected device, or even voice or gesture recognition. To make a good example here, door locks that would open via a certain gesture or even a certain device connected, light systems that you can turn on or off through many gestures, or even when you’re not there at all.<br>
<br>
Basically, things can be done in two ways, semi-auto devices, and gadgets, or fully automated systems that don’t require any input whatsoever.<br>
<br>
In both ways, the goal here is to reduce or even completely remove the human interference to get things done for your home.<br>
<br>
Another thing to understand when you’re looking forward to automating your home, this doesn’t necessarily depend on the type of device. As an example, Smart lights. There are smart lighting systems, smart light switches, or even single light bulbs, which could be controlled from a mobile app or using voice gestures.<br>
<br>
With this given, here that bulb is in the criteria of being a smart device. Taking a deeper look, there are other smart bulbs that would offer the ability to be programmed to turn on or off independently, it could be at certain times you pre input, or even with motion sensors ( Like switching the lights on automatically when entering the room and off when there’s no one there).<br>
<br>
Most of the offered devices which would be considered as semi-auto can also be connected and working within a fully automated home system, removing the need for humans interference completely.<br>
Automate Your Home - Ring Door Notification - Smart Device - Smarthomeoption
Understanding the concepts of Home Automation<br>
Let’s look towards our smart home, the fully automated home, like a machine consisting of many parts (AKA smart devices or gadgets), maybe a bit complexed, but everything is somehow connected and communicating within the system priorly that you priorly setup and programmed.<br>
<br>
Lighting, heating, security, and entertainment devices (as examples, all the possibilities would be later covered) every device will be having its sole role, but everything essentially is working on some basic concepts which cycle would be like:<br>
<br>
Detecting what’s happening around, like motion, temperature, smoke or any sudden disturbance, or sensing sound and light.<br>
Processing inputs, or commands given.<br>
Responding to the commands, following instructions that you already programmed.
The common thing between most of the smart devices is having “sensors”, they can sense certain changes or things happening around. The sensors here are the eyes and ears of your automated home, it’s the source of input for your smart home. The next step here is responding, even taking certain action or passing the information to your other connected devices. As an example, light system could be set to turn off automatically according to the thermostat which knows you’re not home.<br>
<br>
Let’s be more simple..<br>
you’re building a network of devices which gather information from the surroundings and also from one another, the many types of sensors gives your home the needed information to take the next appropriate action.<br>
<br>
When a certain sensor is active, the smart devices is already programmed and knows it’s job, smoothly everything is done as you want it to. As an example, your Amazon Echo device would be taking your voice command to make coffee or if there’s a connected motion sensor, it would know that you wake up, and automatically pass this to your smart coffee machine, which will automatically work and make your morning coffee with zero effort from your side.
<br>
Using those smart devices and building a fully automated home system, simply will change your daily home routine, with a good part of it happening automatically. Making life simple!<br>
<br>
Getting into Basics, what exactly can I automate?<br>
Finally, the huge tech advancements throughout the last few years, made it possible to automate your home, fully and easily. Previously the home automation systems were simpler, limited to timer lamps and some auto recording features for TVs and VCRs. Things have turned quite different.<br>
<br>
Nowadays, automation tech and smart home devices are for everyone, it’s on every appliances market, it’s even on amazon. Too many house devices and gadgets could be automated, now it’s possible that you can literally program your home, forget about it, it’s running on its own!<br>
<br>
Auto locks for your front doors, or even the insides, Lighting switching on in the evening and off when it’s sleeping time autonomously, a coffee machine that knows when you’d like to have a fresh cup of coffee, thermostats that know exactly the temperature you prefer or setting it according to home temperature and what time of year it’s, and more importantly a reminder for you to drink some water, it’s good for your health!<br>
<br>
Those are just a few ideas for how home automation would help you day by day, making home a warmer and better place to be. Looking forward, personally, I think a few years from now the way we live would be changed drastically!<br>
<br>
So, what to automate? And How? It’s your decision now!<br>
Take a look at your daily routine, the things you need to do on daily basis, the boring home environment tasks, how often does that change? There are many daily based tasks you do without even noticing or paying attention, too many hours pass while you’re doing the same tasks you just do every day, and when it’s the weekend you’d still have too many things to do just maintaining your home.<br>
<br>
Asking yourself these questions you’d easily be identifying the most repetitive tasks you carry, here’s the perfect start for you in the way to the dream smart home. Once you identified the boring task, let’s automate that, you can easily find the best smart device for that job, I pet.<br>
<br>
Let’s look at my day for example; Alarm ringing, Bathroom lights on, heating water for my morning shower, making my coffee, checking that home is alright, locking the door, and go to work.<br>
<br>
Most of that routine can be automated making my morning easier, helping me to think less about the boring stuff, giving myself a bit more time even to enjoy the fresh morning breeze.<br>
<br>
Now you know the concepts behind home automation, have a good idea about all the what’s and how’s, let’s step forward and start getting into more detail.

		<summary>Advantages of Smart Blinds</summary>
		<b>1. Convenience:</b> Motorized blinds are a great investment for homes with multiple blinds as they cut the time and effort in opening and closing your shades. “Siri, close the lounge room blinds”
In addition, full remote control doesn’t require you to be in the same room to open or close your blinds. You can be in an adjacent room or in another town to automate the control of your window blinds. <br>
<b>2. Efficiency & Automation</b> to Ensure Maximum Comfort: While motorized blinds offer convenience, they utilize the natural light and ventilation your windows provide for your interiors.
Easily automate or program to open or close according to your preference, even when not at home. You can also choose to link your blinds to the weather and have them automatically close if the sun is strong and the outside temperature reaches a predetermined level. It lowers the need for your air conditioning systems to work hard to bring the temperature to a comfortable level. <br>
<b>3. Safety:</b> An automated window blind eliminates the need for dangling drawstrings which often knot or get in the way. Young children are also tempted to play with the pull cord tassel from manual blinds that can get tangled or pulled down, causing damage to your window blinds or, worse, causing accidents.<br> 
<b>4. Security:</b> Motorized blinds can be programmed to open and close automatically at a specific time and day, or alternatively be connected to a smart alarm system to close the blinds automatically when the house is armed. You can give the impression that people are at home by operating lights and blinds automatically which will discourage intruders from trying to break into your home  open your home. This is called “mockupancy”.<br>
<b>5. Prolong Blind Life:</b> An erratic or pulling the chord the wrong way too often can damage the slats or strings of your window blinds. With motorized blinds, you have precise control with accurate and safe operation, prolonging your blinds’ service life. <br>
<b>6. Neat Appearance:</b> The cordless built motorized blinds not only prevent accidents caused by playful young kids and pets but eliminates the eyesore of drawstrings, leaving you with neat and unobstructed blinds. <br>
<b>7. Quiet Operations: </b>Aside from the convenience of operating your window blinds via your phone or voice, quality models of motorized blinds operate very quietly. Moreover, the motor systems are concealed while working silently.  
In addition, the motorized mechanism is not only available for blinds, but there are also motorized models for curtains, roller blinds, venetians and other types of window hardware.

		<summary>Disadvantages of Smart Blinds</summary>
		<b>1. Consume power:</b> Like your desktop computer or mobile phone, these gadgets won’t function without power which is most likely to deter homeowners from opting for motorized blinds.
Although, there are available motorized blinds that have backup batteries or solar energy converters in case a power outage occurs. But still becomes an inconvenience for areas that have frequent power outages, and with technology, we know that the possibility of glitches can still occur. <br>
<b>2. Costs:</b> The upfront cost of smart blinds can be expensive, especially for the higher-end designs with smart-tech and voice integrations.
For example, solar-powered and hybrid models (combination of plug-in and solar) will cost even more, especially when they can have preset settings and is controllable through smartphones.<br>
Another added cost is when you want to conceal 240 volt wiring for motorized blinds (or mount a plug-in power source) as you need a professional electrician to perform the installation. While this option costs more upfront, you’ll still save a lot by going for a battery powered alternative to 240 volt power supply. This will help cut your energy bills, not to mention the convenience and time-saving advantages it provides. The only problem with batteries is they run out and the thought of charging a window blind doesn’t appeal to many people.<br>
<b>3. Technological Difficulties:</b> people who are not comfortable with smart devices may find the operation arduous. Moreover, technical difficulties may arise just like any tech device where malfunction and glitches may occur, especially for low-quality models.
Damaged or malfunctioning motorized blinds will need professional repairs, although most motorized blind suppliers provide warranties. You’ll also find plug-and-play options for motorized blinds that don’t need any complex configurations to operate.

		<summary>Costs of Smart Blinds</summary>
		As of October 2021, motorized blinds cost between $350 to $700 per window (depending upon size). If you plan to make it a DIY project, you’ll save around $35 to $75 per window as there are motorized blind kits that offer easy-to-follow instructions for homeowners.<br>
To provide a estimate for you, a 120cm x 90cm standard window will cost you around $220 to $350. The more windows you have, the more savings you get for a DIY installation. 
Materials: <br>
• Basic Motor: $220 to $350 <br>
• High-end Tech Motor: $350 to $1000<br>
• Blinds: $25 to $200 <br>
Installation Cost: Using our 120cm x 90cm size window as a basis, you’ll spend around $500. Add 3% per additional square metre to your cost. So, for instance, a 1.5 square metre window will cost you $560 for your installation cost. <br>
Factors to Consider: Aside from the window size, material choice, motor, and modifications, geographical location can also influence your motorized blind cost.
